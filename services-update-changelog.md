## 📈 IMPACT ON PROJECT

### Content Volume:
**Added to Phase 2:**
- Processing Facilities: 900 words × 2 languages = 1,800 words
- Feed Mill Design: 900 words × 2 languages = 1,800 words
- Equipment Design: 800 words × 2 languages = 1,600 words
**Total Added:** 5,200 words

### Timeline Impact:
- All three pages scheduled for Week 5 (Phase 2)
- No impact on Phase 1 critical path
- Phase 2 now has 4 engineering service pages instead of 1

### Photography Needs:
**Additional images required:**
- Processing facilities: 5 images
- Feed mill: 5 images (can use Neusatz Aqua feed mill)
- Equipment: 4 images (drum filters, custom equipment)
**Total: 14 additional images**

---

## ✅ STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT

### Why These Additions Make Sense:

#### 1. **Processing Facilities Design**
- Completes the farm-to-market story
- Many clients need end-to-end solutions
- Differentiates from competitors who only do farm design
- Natural extension of "turnkey" positioning

#### 2. **Feed Mill Design**
- Already referenced in Neusatz Aqua project
- Critical component of aquaculture operations
- Shows vertical integration capability
- Another revenue stream / service offering

#### 3. **Equipment Design Service**
- Transforms sales page into service offering
- Aligns with consultancy positioning
- Showcases engineering expertise
- References Vismar's own equipment (Ecodrum, Aquadrum)
- Positions custom design as value-add vs commodity sales

### Overall Positioning Impact:

**Before:** Looked like farm designers who also sell equipment
**After:** Complete aquaculture engineering consultancy offering:
- ✅ Farm design (RAS, HFTS, hatchery)
- ✅ Water systems (treatment, management)
- ✅ Processing (post-harvest)
- ✅ Feed production (feed mill)
- ✅ Equipment engineering (custom design)
- ✅ Software solutions (NEW - already added)
- ✅ Full DBOT methodology (design-build-operate-transfer)

**Result:** Most comprehensive service offering in the aquaculture engineering space.
