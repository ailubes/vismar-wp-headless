## 🌿 SERVICE 2: NATURAL SWIMMING POOLS & ECO-PONDS

### Chemical-Free Swimming in Harmony with Nature

**The Natural Swimming Pool Revolution**

Inspired by mountain lakes and natural swimming holes, natural pools (also called swim ponds or eco-pools) combine the refreshment of swimming with the beauty of natural water features—without chemicals.

---

### What is a Natural Swimming Pool?

**Definition:**
A natural swimming pool is a man-made body of water that uses biological filtration instead of chemicals to maintain clean, swimmable water.

**Key Components:**

**1. Swimming Zone:**
- Clear water area for swimming
- Typically 2-4 meters deep
- Smooth, swimmable bottom
- No plant growth in swimming area

**2. Regeneration Zone:**
- Planted area with aquatic plants
- Acts as biological filter
- 30-50% of total surface area
- Shallow (30-80cm depth)

**3. Filtration System:**
- Natural (plants, beneficial bacteria, substrate)
- Optional mechanical (skimmer, pump)
- Optional biological (biofilm reactors)
- Circulation to maintain water quality

---

### How Natural Pools Work

**Biological Filtration Process:**

**Stage 1: Mechanical Filtration**
- Debris removed by skimmer
- Solids settled in pre-filter
- Coarse materials trapped

**Stage 2: Biological Filtration**
- Water flows through regeneration zone
- Bacteria colonize gravel and roots
- Nutrients absorbed by plants
- Algae outcompeted by aquatic plants

**Stage 3: Plant Uptake**
- Aquatic plants absorb nitrates and phosphates
- Oxygenate water through photosynthesis
- Provide habitat for beneficial organisms
- Create natural balance

**Stage 4: Circulation**
- Gentle water movement
- Prevents stagnation
- Distributes oxygen
- Maintains clarity

**Result:** Crystal-clear, chemical-free water safe for swimming

Koi ponds represent the perfect intersection of our expertise: they require the same water quality management as fish farms, but with an artistic, aesthetic dimension. We engineer koi ponds that keep fish healthy while creating stunning garden features.

---

### What Makes a Proper Koi Pond?

**Not Just a Pond with Fish:**

A true koi pond is an engineered aquatic life support system designed specifically for koi carp (Cyprinus carpio), one of the most demanding ornamental fish species.

**Key Requirements:**

- Depth: Minimum 3 feet (0.9m), ideal 4-6 feet (1.2-1.8m)

**2. Filtration:**
- Mechanical filtration (remove solids)
- Biological filtration (process ammonia/nitrite)
- 3-5 times pond volume per hour circulation
- Filter capacity: 20-30% of pond volume

**3. Water Quality:**

## ❓ FAQ

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can you design pools outside of Ukraine?**
A: Yes! We work internationally. We can design remotely with site visit, or fully remotely with local survey data.

**Q: Do you also do construction, or just engineering?**
A: We offer both. Engineering-only or full design-build services. Your choice.

**Q: What's the difference between a natural pool and a regular pool?**
A: Natural pools use biological filtration (plants, bacteria) instead of chemicals. No chlorine, more eco-friendly, unique aesthetic.

**Q: How much does a koi pond cost?**
A: Highly variable. Small: €13K-23K. Medium: €23K-50K. Large: €50K-115K+. Depends on size, filtration, features.

**Q: Can I DIY with your engineering plans?**
A: Yes! We provide complete plans you can build yourself or use with contractor.

**Q: Do you provide maintenance services?**
A: We provide maintenance training and consulting. For ongoing maintenance, we can recommend local partners or train your staff.

**Q: How long does design take?**
A: Conceptual design: 2-3 weeks. Full engineering: 6-12 weeks. Depends on complexity and permitting requirements.

**Q: What's included in the engineering fee?**
A: See package descriptions above. Typically: design, engineering, drawings, specifications, permit support.

**Q: Do you guarantee the design will work?**
A: Yes. We stand behind our engineering. If built per our plans, system will perform as designed.
